## Character Creation

You can create characters using the rules in the Player’s Handbook and per the rules below. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fBEv1yDNTD-vwUyK6pK_oiXg2K7OiltW35iFCqxyMTY/edit?gid=552371857#gid=552371857">Allowed Content</a> document contains all available options for use on the server for character creation. There is no limit on the number of characters you can create and control, but each character must have their own sheet in your server folder as well as a MAL entry. 

Any document that captures and clearly conveys all key character information can serve as a character sheet, but you can use the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iePAm5k_IXcoi0LyiIeRErqvHqtuq5Gi/view">MPMB sheet</a> that is provided.  If you elect to use DnDBeyond (DNDB), please refer to Appendix D for recommended settings.

If you are new to DND and do not have access to the rule books yet, a lot of the "core" rules are legally available for download under creative commons and published here:

The following additional rules apply during character creation beyond the official rules for character creation

| | |
|:-------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version | You can create characters using the ruleset in either the 2014 or 2024 Player's Handbook (PHB). For 2024 characters, refer to the rules and guidelines in Appendix A |
|Starting Level | Characters are created with a starting level of either level 3 or level 5 (your choice). Follow the rules to create a level 1 PC and level them up to your desired starting level. Note: Some campaigns may require you to start at level 1; your PC is treated as level 3 for purposes of all other server rules. |
| Allowed Content | Only the character options listed in Allowed Content (Races, Classes, Backgrounds, Languages, Feats and Spells tabs) can be used. Server specific rulings and rule changes (known as Rage Advice) are present as line items next to listed options.|
| Origin | Characters must fit within the server setting of the Forgotten Realms and broader 5e multiverse.  You may choose to have a PC not native to Toril but bear in mind that if your character is banished back to their plane of origin, they can’t be played again unless they are rescued during an adventure or if they can travel back to Toril (e.g. Plane Shift). |
| Guild Membership | Any character you create and can play must be a member of the guild, which includes being willing to provide blood or another body part as well as being willing to adhere to the guild code of conduct as described earlier |
| Age | Your character must be at least a young adult for their species (16 years or older for humans) |
| Race / Species | You can’t reflavor your character’s chosen species except as follows: your character can narratively be a mixture of species listed in Allowed Content and choosing the statistics of one of the species to play (e.g. a half-elf, half-dwarf, played using the Elf statistics).
| Customizing Your Origin | The *Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything* rules for Customizing Your Origin can be used, except that your chosen racial languages must include Common. Custom Lineage isn’t allowed. |
| Lineages | ou can choose to apply *Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft* Lineages to another allowed species at character creation, retaining only skill proficiencies and climbing, swimming, or flying speed from the original species as written.
| Ability Scores | Only point buy (27) or standard array can be used. This calculator can be used for point buy.
