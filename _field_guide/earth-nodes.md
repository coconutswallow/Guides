# Earth Nodes

Beneath the surface of the earth run streams and currents of magical energy. This energy sometimes forms into nexuses that can create a number of magical effects and whose powers can be harnessed. These nexuses are known as **earth nodes**.

This document provides information regarding earth nodes (as well as other kinds of nodes) that exist throughout the world and whose powers can be harnessed by both heroes and villains alike. 

For DMs, this document presents an optional ruleset and detailed mechanics for those wishing to incorporate such nodes into their storylines in appropriate adventure locations. The information is presented to provide a detailed set of guidelines and mechanics by which to utilize earth nodes in your storylines while also leaving freedom to customize or tailor earth nodes as they may pertain to your specific stories.

For players, this document presents information regarding earth nodes as you may encounter them in the adventures your characters undergo, should your DM choose to utilize the content in this document. The information here can be referenced by players for interactions involving earth nodes in game sessions, as well as with respect to the Node Spellcasting and Node Manifestation Supernatural Gifts that can be acquired by player characters. 

This document describes a variety of mechanics associated with earth nodes, including their use in adventures and in downtime. A player character can **only** interact with and utilize the properties of an earth node in an adventure or during downtime given the permission of and as supervised by the DM that is utilizing the earth node in their storylines.

## Features of Earth Nodes

Beneath the earth, pools, and streams of invisible power sometimes collect and cross into a single location, creating an underground nexus of magical energy. Such areas are known as **earth nodes**. An earth node is not by itself visible to ordinary sight, but earth nodes are often located in places that are beautiful or bizarre. As an example, a large geode or an underground cavern in the Underdark might contain an earth node within it, but such sights aren't always present. 

The power of an earth node isn't limited by physical boundaries. Some earth nodes lie within large underground caverns, while others exist entirely within solid rock. Still other earth nodes may have a portion that lies within a cave or tunnel, while the rest extends into stone. Some earth nodes may extend partly or even fully into the surface above.

## Properties of Earth Nodes

Earth nodes come in different levels of strength and extent as indicated by their class. The higher a given earth node's class, the more powerful the earth node is. The majority of earth nodes fall between class 1 and class 5, as weaker earth nodes are more common. It is believed that half of all earth nodes are class 1, one-quarter are class 2, and the majority of the remainder are class 3 or class 4.

Earth nodes of class 2 or higher consist of multiple nested circular layers, with a number of layers equal to the class of the earth node. For example, a class 1 earth node has only a single layer, whereas a class 3 earth node has 3 distinct layers. Each layer of the earth node has its own individual class rating, with the innermost layer having the highest rating equal to the class rating of the earth node as a whole, and each layer beyond it having a class rating as one less than the layer before. For example, a class 3 earth node has an inner layer with a class rating of 3, a middle layer with a class rating of 2, and an outer layer with a class rating of 1.

The power of an earth node can enhance spellcasting and create other magical effects. A creature that is aware of an earth node can attempt to utilize its powers, but the process of doing so requires effort. Creatures with the **Node Spellcasting** or **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gifts have developed a heightened sense and ability for utilizing earth nodes, as detailed on the following pages.

The table below describes various associated properties of an earth node.

## Sensing Earth Nodes

Earth nodes themselves are invisible to ordinary perception, but they can be detected as a sense of magic in the area. Any creature that approaches within 30 feet of an earth node or that enters the area can make a passive or active check (DC 15) as described below to notice the earth node and to recognize it as an earth node. 

* **Non-Spellcasters** make an Intelligence check.
* **Spellcasters** make an ability check using their spellcasting ability.
* **Spellcasters with the Node Spellcasting Supernatural Gift** make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability.
* **Mystics** make an Intelligence check.
* **Mystics with the Node Manifestation Supernatural Gift** make an Intelligence (Arcana) check.

A creature using the *detect magic* spell automatically detects and recognizes an earth node within the spell's range.

A creature that senses an earth node in this way is able to map out the earth node's boundaries. The process requires time as it takes travel and observation to map out the boundaries of an earth node. As a guideline, without factoring in additional time due to physical barriers or other obstacles, it takes 10 minutes to map out the inner layer of an earth node. Each layer beyond the inner layer takes an additional 10 minutes for each layer before it.

For example, a class 3 earth node has 3 layers: an inner, middle, and outer layer. It takes 10 minutes to map out the inner layer, 20 minutes to map out the middle layer, and 30 minutes to map out the outer layer. In total, it would take at least one hour to map out a class 3 earth node. 

The *commune with nature* spell can also be used to locate (but not map out) any earth nodes within the spell's range.

## Studying Earth Nodes

Utilizing some of the powers associated with an earth node requires one to spend time and effort in study of a particular earth node and learning its specific pattern of magical energy. This can occur in the following two ways:

* A creature that is aware of a given earth node can become **proficient** in their understanding of that earth node's pattern of magical energy by spending a short rest within the area while studying its pattern of magical energy. At the end of the short rest, the creature can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against the node DC of the earth node. On a success, the creature commits the earth node to memory as if it were the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle.
* A creature with the **Node Spellcasting** Supernatural Gift that is also **proficient** in their understanding of a specific earth node's pattern of magical energy can additionally acquire **expertise** in their understanding of that earth node's pattern of magical energy. The creature can study the energies of a given earth node for a number of workweeks of downtime while in the area of the earth node, spending at least 8 hours each day engaged in the activity. At the end of each workweek, the creature must make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability against the node DC of the earth node. The creature must acquire a number of total successes in this way equal to the earth node's class rating. Each failure on this check reduces the number of accumulated successes by 1, but cannot reduce it below zero. For example, studying a class 3 earth node in this way requires 3 successful Arcana checks over a minimum of 3 workweeks but could require more if failures occur.

## Powers of Earth Nodes

Earth nodes are nexuses of magical energy, enhancing spellcasting and creating other magical effects. Those aware of an earth node are capable of taking advantage of its powers and capabilities. 

Certain powers can be accessed only by those practiced and experienced in utilizing the powers of an earth node, which are individuals with the **Node Spellcasting** and/or **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift. Powers which are restricted in this way are indicated below.

### Enhanced Spellcasting

A creature that is aware of a given earth node while within its area can utilize it to enhance their own spellcasting. 

When casting a spell whilst in the area of a layer of a given earth node, a creature can make a check against the node DC of that earth node layer as part of the action of casting the spell.

* **Non-Spellcasters** make an Intelligence check.
* **Spellcasters** make an ability check using their spellcasting ability.
* **Spellcasters with the Node Spellcasting Supernatural Gift** make an Arcana check using their spellcasting ability.

On a success, the spell that is cast is treated as if it was cast at a number of levels higher equal to half the class rating of the earth node layer, rounded up. Spells cast at a higher level in this way still cannot be cast above 9th-level.

For example, a creature that casts a 1st-level *magic missile* spell while within an earth node layer with a class rating of 3 that succeeds on the associated check against the node DC of 18 casts the spell as if it had been cast at two levels higher, thus casting the spell at 3rd-level. 

A creature may additionally choose to use less of the earth node's power for a given earth node layer if they wish to, treating as if the creature was attempting the ability check against a node DC for a layer of a lower class rating of their choice and thereby cast the spell at a number of levels higher equal to half that class rating, rounded up.

For example, a creature that casts a 1st-level *magic missile* spell while within an earth node layer with a class rating of 3 can choose to make the ability check against the node DC of an earth node layer with a class rating of 2 (node DC 16). On a success, the creature's 1st-level *magic missile* would be treated as if it had been cast one level higher, casting the spell at 2nd-level. 

<table border=1><tr><th>Mystics</th></tr>

<tr><td>A creature with levels in the Mystic class that is aware of an earth node can use an action to gain a number of special psi points as if they had used their Psionic Mastery feature. (This does not count against the number of uses granted by their Psionic Mastery class feature.) The pool of psi points gained from this action is equal to 8 + the class rating of the earth node. 

A creature that uses this action can't do so again until 24 hours pass, and an earth node can grant this benefit up to a number of creatures equal to its class rating per day.

A mystic with the **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gift can instead use this action twice per day.</td></tr></table>
