This document provides information regarding earth nodes (as well as other kinds of nodes) that exist throughout the world and whose powers can be harnessed by both heroes and villains alike. 



For DMs, this document presents an optional ruleset and detailed mechanics for those wishing to incorporate such nodes into their storylines in appropriate adventure locations. The information is presented to provide a detailed set of guidelines and mechanics by which to utilize earth nodes in your storylines while also leaving freedom to customize or tailor earth nodes as they may pertain to your specific stories.



For players, this document presents information regarding earth nodes as you may encounter them in the adventures your characters undergo, should your DM choose to utilize the content in this document.
