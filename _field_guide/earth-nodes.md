# Earth Nodes

Beneath the surface of the earth run streams and currents of magical energy. This energy sometimes forms into nexuses that can create a number of magical effects and whose powers can be harnessed. These nexuses are known as **earth nodes**.

This document provides information regarding earth nodes (as well as other kinds of nodes) that exist throughout the world and whose powers can be harnessed by both heroes and villains alike. 

For DMs, this document presents an optional ruleset and detailed mechanics for those wishing to incorporate such nodes into their storylines in appropriate adventure locations. The information is presented to provide a detailed set of guidelines and mechanics by which to utilize earth nodes in your storylines while also leaving freedom to customize or tailor earth nodes as they may pertain to your specific stories.

For players, this document presents information regarding earth nodes as you may encounter them in the adventures your characters undergo, should your DM choose to utilize the content in this document. The information here can be referenced by players for interactions involving earth nodes in game sessions, as well as with respect to the Node Spellcasting and Node Manifestation Supernatural Gifts that can be acquired by player characters. 

This document describes a variety of mechanics associated with earth nodes, including their use in adventures and in downtime. A player character can **only** interact with and utilize the properties of an earth node in an adventure or during downtime given the permission of and as supervised by the DM that is utilizing the earth node in their storylines.

## Features of Earth Nodes

Beneath the earth, pools, and streams of invisible power sometimes collect and cross into a single location, creating an underground nexus of magical energy. Such areas are known as **earth nodes**. An earth node is not by itself visible to ordinary sight, but earth nodes are often located in places that are beautiful or bizarre. As an example, a large geode or an underground cavern in the Underdark might contain an earth node within it, but such sights aren't always present. 

The power of an earth node isn't limited by physical boundaries. Some earth nodes lie within large underground caverns, while others exist entirely within solid rock. Still other earth nodes may have a portion that lies within a cave or tunnel, while the rest extends into stone. Some earth nodes may extend partly or even fully into the surface above.

## Properties of Earth Nodes

Earth nodes come in different levels of strength and extent as indicated by their class. The higher a given earth node's class, the more powerful the earth node is. The majority of earth nodes fall between class 1 and class 5, as weaker earth nodes are more common. It is believed that half of all earth nodes are class 1, one-quarter are class 2, and the majority of the remainder are class 3 or class 4.

Earth nodes of class 2 or higher consist of multiple nested circular layers, with a number of layers equal to the class of the earth node. For example, a class 1 earth node has only a single layer, whereas a class 3 earth node has 3 distinct layers. Each layer of the earth node has its own individual class rating, with the innermost layer having the highest rating equal to the class rating of the earth node as a whole, and each layer beyond it having a class rating as one less than the layer before. For example, a class 3 earth node has an inner layer with a class rating of 3, a middle layer with a class rating of 2, and an outer layer with a class rating of 1.

The power of an earth node can enhance spellcasting and create other magical effects. A creature that is aware of an earth node can attempt to utilize its powers, but the process of doing so requires effort. Creatures with the **Node Spellcasting** or **Node Manifestation** Supernatural Gifts have developed a heightened sense and ability for utilizing earth nodes, as detailed on the following pages.

The table below describes various associated properties of an earth node.
