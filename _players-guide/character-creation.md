## Character Creation

You can create characters using the rules in the Player’s Handbook and per the rules below. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fBEv1yDNTD-vwUyK6pK_oiXg2K7OiltW35iFCqxyMTY/edit?gid=552371857#gid=552371857">Allowed Content</a> document contains all available options for use on the server for character creation. There is no limit on the number of characters you can create and control, but each character must have their own sheet in your server folder as well as a MAL entry. 

Any document that captures and clearly conveys all key character information can serve as a character sheet, but you can use the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iePAm5k_IXcoi0LyiIeRErqvHqtuq5Gi/view">MPMB sheet</a> that is provided.  If you elect to use DnDBeyond (DNDB), please refer to Appendix D for recommended settings.

If you are new to DND and do not have access to the rule books yet, a lot of the "core" rules are legally available for download under creative commons and published here:
