- question: "What's server stance on use of AI images for characters?"
  category: "Rules"
  answer: |
    The server takes no official stance on AI generated images. Players and DMs are allowed to use it in their own games and for their characters. Some players and DMs prefer not to play in games where AI generated images are present, which is typically indicated in a game ad. We do also have and promote several active Artists in our community, the nature of whose work is obviously entangled with the existence of AI generated images.

- question: "Does the server play D&D 2014 or 2024 Games?"
  category: "Games"
  answer: |
    There's a number of DMs that run 2014 games and there's a fair amount of older 2014 PCs among more tenured server members here. However, folks typically are curious and interested to try out the new options, so 2024 games are statistically more prevalent overall. To clarify and bear in mind as well, 2014 PCs can play without issue in either 2014 or 2024 games.

- question: "Can a 2024 character use any 2014 class / subclass / race / feat?"
  category: "Character Creation"
  answer: |
    If there is no 2024 version of it you may use the 2014 version, otherwise you must use the 2024 version.  For example: 
    * 2024 Cleric, 2014 Twilight Domain - Permitted
    * 2024 Cleric, 2014 Life Domain - Not Permitted

- question: "Do I need to have played games to be a DM on the server?"
  category: "DMing"
  answer: |
    You can apply to be a DM without having played a game yet, you just have to make a request in **#⁠player-requests** to PR and Auditors to check in with you after submitting the form. However, like Thomas said, playing a few games first if possible is recommended to get to know folks and the server.
