- question: "What's server stance on use of AI images for characters?"
  category: "Rules"
  answer: |
    The server takes no official stance on AI generated images. Players and DMs are allowed to use it in their own games and for their characters. Some players and DMs prefer not to play in games where AI generated images are present, which is typically indicated in a game ad. We do also have and promote several active Artists in our community, the nature of whose work is obviously entangled with the existence of AI generated images.
