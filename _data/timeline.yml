     The Baneite structure known as Tyrant's Keep is built in Lerwick by the Black Fists of Bane, and kobolds of Lerwick establish a warrens beneath the keep. Over time, the tensions around Tyrant's Keep explode as the individual known as Tarim takes control of the structure. Tarim captures and tortures inhabitants of Lerwick. A group led by the kobold Tasuk'suva along with the town guard and the Lerwick Roses (then known as the Azure Roses) assault Tyrant's Keep. Many individuals die, with all of the keep's defenders falling. Tarim is captured, but is later assassinated in his cell.
