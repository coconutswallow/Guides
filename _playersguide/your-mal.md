## What is your Master Adventurer's Log (MAL) ?

Your MAL is the single-source-of truth logging all pertinent activity for your character on the server.  Everything you gain (xp, gold, equipment) and spend on your character is logged here, so that we can make sure that we have a fair and even playing ground for everyone.

### Your first MAL entry

Once you've created your first character sheet, you should create add the character in your MAL.

The first row of each character should be a "character creation" session, which logs the character's initial XP and GP (depending on whether they start at level 3 or level 5), starting equipment.

If you decided to purchase additional equipment (from the equipment tab on the Allowed Content), log the purchase under Downtime Log and add the inventory in the inventory sections.

<code>mydiscord_id as character-name (level) spends xx GP to purchase goods</code>

Example:

<code>@player1 as Robin Hood (5) spends 35GP to purchase 1x Shortbow and 1x Leather Armor</code>

**Note:** that reselling equipment to the general market is at 50% value of the original purchase price.  You can also buy and sell goods to other players.  See section on Trades in Downtime Activities for more details.
