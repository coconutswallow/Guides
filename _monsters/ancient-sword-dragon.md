Sword dragons are a powerful and exceedingly rare variant of dragons, spawned from dragons hoarding vast quantities of magical swords. Such dragons don't share their parents' traits, and are often abandoned after they show their appetite for consuming valuable weaponry.  
  
  **Sharp Appearance**. A sword dragon appears to be made out of various bladed weapons, and its scales take the appearance of sharpened daggers that extend to longer blades as it ages. Consuming vast quantities of magical items often causes the dragon to develop powerful traits that make it an epic foe.  The material of the dragon's scales also magically changes as the dragon ages: heavy iron for wyrmlings, tempered steel for young dragons, lightweight mithral for adults, and
  hardened adamantine for ancients. 
  
### Customising a Sword Dragon. 
  To add traits to a sword dragon, choose the sword dragon stat block for the dragon's age category: wyrmling, young, adult or ancient. Then roll once each table for each successive age category the dragon has achieved, starting from wyrmling, to determine its additional traits. If a trait doesm't specify a saving throw DC, use the same DC as the dragon's breath weapon. 
  
#### Sword Dragon Wyrmling Traits
  *d4 Sword Dragon Wyrmling Trait*
  - 1 **Alert**. The dragon has advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the dragon and any of its allies within 30 feet of it can't be surprised.
  - 2 **Dominating**. The dragon can cast the command and dominate beast spells at will using its Innate Spellcasting.
  - 3 **Vengeful**. The dragon can use its reaction to make one melee attack against a creature in its reach that dealt damage to it.
  - 4 **Wrathful**. Once on each of its turns, if the dragon hits a target, each creature of its choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage.
  
#### Young Sword Dragon Traits
  *d4 Young Sword Dragon Trait*
  - 1 **Baneful**. The dragon has advantage on attack rolls against a particular kind of creature, and those creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against
  the dragon's breath weapon. The kind of creature can be a type, race, or group.
  - 2 **Draining**. Once on each of its turns, the dragon can deal an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage when it his a creature with an attack, and the dragon gains
  temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
  - 3 **Metamorpic**. The dragon can use a bonus action to gain resistance to either acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage. The resistance lasts until the dragon uses a
  bonus action to gain another resistance. In addition, the dragon can change the damage type of its attacks and breath weapon to the same type as the chosen
  resistance. 
  - 4 **Vicious**. If the dragon scores a critical hit against a creature, it rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice.
  
#### Adult Sword Dragon Traits
  *d4 Adult Sword Dragon Trait*
  - 1 **Commanding**. Once on each of its turns, the dragon can enable one other creature within 60 feet of it to make one weapon attack as a reaction, move up to its
  speed as a reaction, or gain the benefits of the Dodge action.
  - 2 **Sharpened**. When the dragon reduces a creature to 0 hit points with an attack, the dragon lops off one of the creature's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limb to sever, the dragon lops off a portion of the creature's body instead.
  - 3 **Slaying**. Once on each of its turns, if the dragon hits a creature that has 100 hit points or fewer, the dragon can force the creature to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. 
  - 4 **Swift**. The dragon can make one attack as a bonus action on each of its turns.
  
#### Ancient Sword Dragon Traits
  *d4 Ancient Sword Dragon Trait*
  - 1 **Avenging**. The dragon's attacks deal an additional 11 (2d10) radiant damage. In addition, the dragon and any allies within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. 
  - 2 **Lucky**. The dragon has advantage on all saving throws. In addition, the dragon can reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it dislikes, and it must use the second roll. Once it uses this trait to reroll, it can't do so again until the start of its next turn.
  - 3 **Reshaping**. The dragon gains a +3 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. The first time the dragon attacks on its turn, it can transfer some or all of the bonus to its Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of the dragon's next turn.
  - 4 **Vorpal**. The dragon's attacks and breath weapon ignore resistance to piercing and slashing damage. If the dragon scores a critical hit against a creature, the
  target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or the dragon cuts off the target's head. The target dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature that
  doesn't have or need a head, or has legendary actions, instead takes an extra 27 (6d8) slashing damage.

>

> requiring no material components:

> ### Legendary Actions
> The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's
>
> **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
>
> **Attack.** The dragon makes a **Tail** or **Wing Blade** attack.
>
> **At-Will Spell.** The dragon casts one of its at-will spells.
>
> **Blade Dash (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and it can make one **Wing Blade** attack against each creature it moves past.
>
> **Sword Step (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon teleports in a burst of swords up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is within 5 feet of a blade, including one created by magic (such as a *blade barrier* or a *cloud of daggers*). Then each creature within 10 feet of the space the dragon left takes 13 (3d8) slashing damage.
>
> ### Lair Actions
>
> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 
>
> - 1d4 + 1 of the dragon's scales detach to defend the dragon. The scales have the statistics of flying swords and act on initiative count 20. The constructs last for 1 minute, after which they become inanimate once again. 
>
> - The dragon's scales become primed with magical energy.  Until initiative count 20 on the next round, each time the dragon takes 10 or more damage, its scales burst out and each creature within 10 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage.
>
> - A swirling cloud of swords forms 10 feet around the dragon, which follows the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. The cloud provides the dragon with three-quarters cover, and the area 10 feet around the dragon becomes difficult terrain for other creatures.  When a creature enters the cloud's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
>
> ### Regional Effects
>
> The region containing a legendary sword dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
>
> - Blades rain down on a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it in a 10-foot-high, 10-foot-radius cylinder. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
> - Grass and plants within 6 miles of the lair are razor sharp and hazardous to outsiders. The area covered by the vegetation is difficult terrain, and when a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2 (1d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
>
> - Protrusions of earth and stone within 6 miles of the dragon's lair form into blade-like shapes. Any rock formations may resemble oversized swords.
>
> - Knives on occasion rain from the sky within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. Creatures caught in the rain take 1 piercing damage each turn until they can find shelter.
>
> - Whirling blades scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A whirling blade has the statistics of an air elemental, it has a speed of 50 feet, it has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5), and its damage rolls deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
>
> - Blades brought within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sharpen themselves and never dull while they remain in the area.  The dragon can hear up to 30 feet through any magical, bladed weapon within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.
>
> If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.
