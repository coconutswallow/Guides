## Ancient Sword Dragon

Sword dragons are powerful and exceedingly rare variants of dragons, born from hoarding vast quantities of magical swords. These dragons don’t share their parents’ usual traits and are often abandoned after displaying an appetite for consuming enchanted weaponry.

**Sharp Appearance.** A sword dragon’s body appears forged from countless bladed weapons, with scales resembling sharpened daggers that lengthen as the creature ages. Their scales evolve from heavy iron in wyrmlings, to tempered steel in young dragons, to lightweight mithral in adults, and finally hardened adamantine in ancients. Magical consumption grants them formidable new abilities, making them truly epic foes.

### Customising a Sword Dragon

To customize a sword dragon, start with the base stat block for its age category (wyrmling, young, adult, or ancient). Then, roll once on each previous age category’s table to add traits, beginning from wyrmling up to its current age.  
If a trait doesn’t specify a saving throw DC, use the dragon’s breath weapon DC.

#### Sword Dragon Wyrmling Traits

| d4 | Trait Name | Description |
|:--:|:------------|:-------------|
| 1 | **Alert** | The dragon has advantage on initiative rolls, and neither it nor its allies within 30 ft. can be surprised. |
| 2 | **Dominating** | The dragon can cast *command* and *dominate beast* at will via Innate Spellcasting. |
| 3 | **Vengeful** | The dragon can use its reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that damaged it. |
| 4 | **Wrathful** | When the dragon hits a target, creatures of its choice within 5 ft. of that target take 5 (2d4) slashing damage. |

#### Young Sword Dragon Traits

| d4 | Trait Name | Description |
|:--:|:------------|:-------------|
| 1 | **Baneful** | The dragon has advantage on attack rolls against a chosen kind of creature, which also has disadvantage on saving throws against the dragon’s breath weapon. |
| 2 | **Draining** | Once per turn, the dragon deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and gains that many temporary hit points. |
| 3 | **Metamorphic** | The dragon can use a bonus action to gain resistance to acid, cold, fire, or lightning until it changes again. Its attacks and breath weapon match this damage type. |
| 4 | **Vicious** | On a critical hit, the dragon rolls damage dice three times instead of twice. |

#### Adult Sword Dragon Traits

| d4 | Trait Name | Description |

| 2 | **Sharpened** | When the dragon reduces a creature to 0 HP, it severs a limb or portion of the creature’s body. |
| 3 | **Slaying** | When the dragon hits a creature with 100 HP or fewer, it can force a DC 15 Constitution save or the creature dies instantly. |
| 4 | **Swift** | The dragon can make one extra attack as a bonus action each turn. |

#### Ancient Sword Dragon Traits

| d4 | Trait Name | Description |

| 2 | **Lucky** | The dragon has advantage on all saving throws and can reroll one attack roll, ability check, or save per turn (must use the new roll). |
| 3 | **Reshaping** | The dragon gains a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. On its first attack each turn, it may transfer some or all of this bonus to its AC until its next turn. |
| 4 | **Vorpal** | The dragon’s attacks and breath ignore resistance to piercing/slashing. On a critical hit, the target must make a Con save or be decapitated. |
