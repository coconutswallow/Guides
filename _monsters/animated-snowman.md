The **Animated Snowman** is a mindless protector construct, originally built by nomadic gnomes of the High Ice to guard their settlement from marauding monsters. It is a sentinel that never abandons its post, even as the snow around it melts.
  
  These creatures create festive displays of snow and foliage to hide in plain sight (**False Appearance**). If a creature is killed near their display, they hide the body within another snowman and use the spilled blood to add macabre "rosy cheeks" and "festive stripes" to the scene. The snowman is highly resistant to physical damage due to its **Compacted Snow** trait, which increases its armor, but it is highly vulnerable to fire.
  
  #### Combat Tactics
  The Animated Snowman relies on its **False Appearance** to ambush anything that doesn't resemble its gnomish creators. In combat, it uses **Winter's Breath** to deal burst cold damage and follows up with **Slam** attacks to quickly increase its armor class with **Compacted Snow**. It may use ranged **Snowball** attacks to slow targets with cold damage. The snowman is compelled to stay within the area it was charged to protect.

> ### Traits
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the snowman remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal snowman.
>
> ***Cold Absorption.*** Whenever the snowman is subjected to cold damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the cold damage dealt.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The snowman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Compacted Snow.*** When the snowman is dealt bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or force damage, the outside layer of snow is compacted, making it harder to hit. The snowman gains a **+1 bonus to AC** each time it takes damage from one of these damage types, up to a maximum of AC 20. If the snowman takes fire damage, any AC bonus accumulated from this feature is lost.
